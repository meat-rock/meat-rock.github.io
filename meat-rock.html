	<p>1808: Atomic theory (now <em><u>DEBUNKED</u></em>) published in "scientific" communities was part of a conspiracy to claim that everything is made of simple substances. (A <em>WRONG</em> CLAIM.) <img align="right" class="clip-art" src="https://clipart-library.com/science.png" /></p>

	<p>Atom theory applies an infinite number of parts to any possible thing. So for each thing there can be any number of parts imaginable, and each part has its own substance and meaning. -- <em><u>HOW  </u></em> did anyone believe this? "Science" in general has been unwilling to even CONSIDER more intuitive theories about the substantial nature of reality and therefore has <em>IGNORED</em> the <span class="meat-rock">Meat Rock System</span> in its entirety.
	<br />Lesson: <em>STOP</em> thinking of things in terms of <b>parts</b> and understand them in terms of <span class="diff">WHAT THEY ARE!</span></p>

	<p>Lesson: everything is either <span class="meat-rock">meat</span> or <span class="meat-rock">rock</span>. <img class="clip-art" src="https://clipartix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Teacher-apple-clipart-free-images-10.gif" /> YES: things have parts ... but this is NOT what the thing is! An <u>object</u> is not made of its parts but is what it is made of, <em>i.e.</em> <b>meat or rock</b>.</p>
