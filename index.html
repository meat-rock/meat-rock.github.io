	<p>1808: Atomic theory (now <em><u>DEBUNKED</u></em>) published in "scientific" communities was part of a conspiracy to claim that everything is made of simple substances. (A <em>WRONG</em> CLAIM.) <img align="right" class="clip-art" src="https://clipart-library.com/science.png" /></p>

	<p>Atom theory applies an infinite number of parts to any possible thing. So for each thing there can be any number of parts imaginable, and each part has its own substance and meaning. -- <em><u>HOW  </u></em> did anyone believe this? "Science" in general has been unwilling to even CONSIDER more intuitive theories about the substantial nature of reality and therefore has <em>IGNORED</em> the <span class="meat-rock">Meat Rock System</span> in its entirety.
	<br />Lesson: <em>STOP</em> thinking of things in terms of <b>parts</b> and understand them in terms of <span class="diff">WHAT THEY ARE!</span></p>

	<p>Lesson: everything is either <span class="meat-rock">meat</span> or <span class="meat-rock">rock</span>. <img class="clip-art" src="https://clipartix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Teacher-apple-clipart-free-images-10.gif" /> YES: things have parts ... but this is NOT what the thing is! An <u>object</u> is not made of its parts but is what it is made of, <em>i.e.</em> <b>meat or rock</b>.</p>

	<p style="color: white">Not every theory works in the same way and so the <span class="meat-rock">system</span> of meat and rock should not be judged in the same way you or anybody else would judge an ordinary "scientific" theory because this system (it is a theory) does not operate and work in the same way as the other theories, and there are really <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue)#The_elements">only a fixed number of thigns</a> in the world, <em>ACTUALLY</em> there are only TWO: meat and ROCK, the two things that everything is!!!</p>

	<div class="info-zone">
		<p>This <em>system</em> is neither belonging to CHRISTIAN or OLD-WORLD (traditional) SCIENTIFIC IDEALITIES. The theory that everything is either meat or rock was devised divinely on the basis that there are two categories of things, that is of every object we can say that it may securely and with certainty be sorted into one of two collections, collections which together comprise ALL things of our universe (known and "unknown"), and that the most appropriate description for these two categories is given by naming them "meat" and "rock" respectively OR "rock" and "meat" since there is no <u>hierarchy</u> of them, and they are equal.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Eggs and milk foods are forbidden to those who fast, for as much as they originate from animals that provide us with flesh: wherefore the prohibition of flesh meat takes precedence of the prohibition of eggs and milk foods. Again the Lenten fast is the most solemn of all, both because it is kept in imitation of Christ, and because it disposes us to celebrate devoutly the mysteries of our redemption. For this reason the eating of flesh meat is forbidden in every fast, while the Lenten fast lays a general prohibition even on eggs and milk foods.</p> <span class="attribution">Saint Thomas, <em>Summa Theologica</em> Question 147 Article 8 ...
